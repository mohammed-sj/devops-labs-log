## How to Use This Repo

### Taking Notes

After each lesson, create a note:

```bash
touch 01-linux/notes/file-permissions.md
```

Write in your own words – this helps you remember.

### Completing Labs

Document what you did and what you learned:

```bash
touch 01-linux/labs/lab01-basic-commands.md
```

Include commands, outputs, and any errors you hit.

### Building Projects

Create a folder with your code and a README:

```
01-linux/projects/backup-script/
├── backup.sh
└── README.md
```

## Best Practices

**Commit often** – After each lesson, lab, or meaningful progress.

**Write good commit messages:**

```bash
# Bad
git commit -m "updates"

# Good
git commit -m "Add notes on Linux file permissions"
```

**Stay organised** – Put files in the right folders.

**Share your progress** – Post on LinkedIn, tag @CoderCo!
