## How I Use This Repo

### Notes
Concise explanations written in my own words.

### Labs
Step by step documentation of hands-on exercises, including commands, errors, and lessons learned.

### Projects
Hands-on projects with code and a README explaining design decisions and trade-offs.

## Workflow & Best Practices

- Commit often with meaningful messages
- Document labs clearly so they can be reproduced later
- Aim for clarity, not perfection
- Revisit and improve older labs as skills develop
